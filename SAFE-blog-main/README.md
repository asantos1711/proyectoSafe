This repository includes the R code used in the post, entitled
"Simplify your model: Supervised Assisted Feature Extraction for Machine Learning",
published on the [Responsible ML blog](https://medium.com/responsibleml).


The script `safe_hotels.R` contains the code required to reproduce a use case on Hotel Booking demand data.
The data is originally from the article [Hotel Booking Demand Datasets](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.11.126) in Data in Brief, written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes.

The data can be download, for example, [from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand).
